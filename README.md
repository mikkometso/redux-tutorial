# Redux tutorial

Created this repo as a learning ground for Redux stuff.

I have worked with Redux only in one project earlier and can not honestly say that I'd be able to work with it in a proficient level. Redux is also something that seems to pop up everytime I end up having some initial talks concerning job offers.

So here I am learning Redux and documenting the process along the way. As a learning material I will use **Stephen Griders** [Modern React with Redux](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-redux/) from Udemy.

This project was originally bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
